# release-build.sh — end-to-end signed/notarized release artifact pipeline.
#
# Produces BAR Launcher.app (staged, signed, optionally notarized) from
# the pinned engine tree + pinned/patched Mesa, with EVERY release gate
# unskippable in-line:
#   build (via scripts/build-engine.sh: -O3 RELWITHDEBINFO, gcc dbl-64 swap,
#   dfp-verify 9/9 fleet-parity gate) → replay smoke → bundle staging →
#   license collection + license-audit → codesign (hardened runtime,
#   get-task-allow FORBIDDEN) → notarize+staple (when identity provided) →
#   ditto zip.
#
# Usage:
#   packaging/release-build.sh [--identity "Developer ID Application: ..."]
#                              [--notary-profile <keychain-profile>]
#                              [--version <tag>] [--skip-replay-smoke]
# Without --identity the bundle is ad-hoc signed (local testing only; will
# not pass Gatekeeper on other machines). Notarization runs only when both
# --identity and --notary-profile are given.

# Disabled means the staged chobby_config.json points the lobby at an unreachable
