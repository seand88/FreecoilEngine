#   3. bounded logging: rotation on, rotated logs pruned to the newest 10;

#      the lobby's own UI then downloads game/maps with real progress bars.
#      No Terminal automation (an osascript'd Terminal triggers a macOS

# "potato GPU" mitigation (2026-08-04). BAR's own gui_options.lua classifies the
# GPU by VENDOR, and its chain is: no-GL4 -> potato; NVidia -> check VRAM;
# Intel -> needs "arc"; AMD -> needs "rx"/"r9"; else -> potato. Apple Silicon via
# zink/KosmicKrisp reports vendor "Mesa" and matches none of them, so EVERY Apple
# Mac lands in the catch-all else and is branded low-end (introduced upstream
# 2026-06-30 in 336cf9d9, so v0.11 and v0.12 shipped with it too). On FIRST LAUNCH
# only, that branch writes: water 0, Shadows 0, ShadowMapSize 1024, MSAALevel 0 --
# i.e. it permanently disables water and shadows on an M2 Ultra.
#
# We cannot fix the detection: game content is reference-only (PORTING_PRINCIPLES
# §0) and ships from BAR's CDN, so there is nothing local to patch. The proper fix
# is an Apple/Metal branch upstream -- see docs/OUTSTANDING.md; this is the
# interim, port-side mitigation.
#
# Mechanism: that whole block is gated on `firstlaunchsetupDone`, which BAR
# persists as `firsttimesetupDone` in its LuaUI config. Seeding that marker makes
# BAR skip the downgrade. Because skipping it also skips the GOOD first-launch
# defaults, we reproduce those here (they are plain config values).
# Deliberately seeded ONLY when the config is absent, i.e. a genuinely fresh
# install -- a returning user's file is never touched, and everything below stays
# changeable from BAR's own settings UI.
