# First-run content downloader for the BAR macOS app.
#
# Wraps pr-downloader against the OFFICIAL BAR content network (the same CDN
# the official launcher uses — endpoints from BYAR-Chobby dist_cfg): rapid
# game archives + Chobby lobby + engine maps into the user's write dir.
# Design per release plan §5:
#   - never writes inside the signed .app bundle;
#   - disk-space preflight (content is ~2-3 GB, checked before starting);
#   - resume/retry: pr-downloader's rapid pool is content-addressed, so a
#     re-run resumes where it stopped; we retry each item with backoff.
#
# STRUCTURED OUTPUT (stdout, one message per line) drives the launcher's
# progress window and the debug log:
#   @S <text>          stage / status line
#   @D <text>          detail line (host, tag, counts)
#   @P <int>           percent for the current item (0..100)
#   @I                 indeterminate step (unknown duration)
#   @E:<code> <text>   classified failure (see CODES below) — then exit nonzero
#   @DONE              all requested content present
# The full raw pr-downloader output is written to stderr (the launcher tees
# it to first-run-download.log) so any failure can be diagnosed after the fact.
#
# ERROR CODES (also the process exit code, so callers can branch):
#   2  usage        bad arguments
#   3  disk         not enough free space (preflight, or pr-downloader ran out)
#   4  launch       pr-downloader binary missing / would not start
#   5  network      could not reach the CDN (DNS/connat/TLS) — never got repos
#   6  tag          server reached, but a requested package tag was not found
#   7  content      tag resolved, but the archive/pool download failed/interrupted
#   8  install      downloader killed by a signal (Gatekeeper/quarantine)
# Usage: download-content.sh [--writedir DIR] [--full] [--map "Map Name"]...
set -uo pipefail   # NB not -e: we handle pr-downloader failures explicitly
