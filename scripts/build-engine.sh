# Build the Recoil engine (BAR macOS layer) against the local Mesa KosmicKrisp stack.
# Mirrors ExaDev macos-build-gpu.yml.
#
# Usage: build-engine.sh [--with-synctest] [--with-visreg] [--with-perf]
#
# Tests are OPT-IN (the build itself always runs its fast artifact gates:
# libm parity hashes, arch checks). Run tests with the build for major
# changes / large commits, or standalone at any time:
#   --with-synctest  streflop cross-arch bit-exactness (~seconds, CPU-only)
#                    standalone: scripts/run-synctest.sh
#   --with-visreg    visual/artifact regression scenes vs baselines (~3 min)
#                    standalone: scripts/visreg.sh   (see testkit/visreg/README.md)
#   --with-perf      adds the m7 perf gate to the visreg run (~+4 min)
#                    standalone: scripts/visreg.sh --perf
# Env equivalents: WITH_SYNCTEST=1 WITH_VISREG=1 WITH_PERF=1.

# Reproducibility: strip the absolute build-root prefix out of every

# shipped binaries embed no absolute build path. Maps $BAR -> "."
# for both preprocessor (__FILE__, via -ffile-prefix-map) and debug info
# (-fdebug-prefix-map). Applied to all languages incl. Obj-C/Obj-C++ (macOS .mm)
# and inherited by subprojects (streflop, pr-downloader). Path-string only — no
# effect on codegen or determinism.

# (tools/CMakeLists.txt) so it does NOT inherit engine flags — that also drops
# PREFIX_MAP, leaving ~17 absolute source paths embedded in pr-downloader (and,
# since spring links it, in spring too). It force-builds RelWithDebInfo and does
# NOT clear the per-config *_RELWITHDEBINFO flags, so carrying PREFIX_MAP there
# too reaches pr-downloader. Both the engine and pr-downloader build
# RELWITHDEBINFO, so this is belt-and-suspenders (harmless if applied twice).

# SOURCE-TREE GUARD (2026-08-07). `cmake --fresh` silently RE-POINTS an existing

# running this script without ENGINE_SRC against a build dir that was configured
# from a DIFFERENT tree (e.g. build-engine-2025.06.24-perfpin <- engine-2025.06.24)
# quietly rebases it onto the stale tree. Burned once: the perf-pin build was
# re-pointed at the July `engine/` tree, the edited file never recompiled (right
# edit, wrong tree), and the failure surfaced as an unrelated BARb compile error
# that sent the diagnosis off in the wrong direction entirely. Refuse instead.

#    unnoticed only because the sim never calls double exp. Do not reintroduce.)
#    Gate: dfp hashes vs this lane's committed baseline (drift detection) +
#    replay certification is the parity proof of record.
#  - submodule lane (2026.06.08+): fleet gcc builds use
#    -fsingle-precision-constant (gcc-only); recompile dbl-64 objects with
#    homebrew gcc and relink. Gate: 9/9 hash match vs the gcc x86 VM reference.
