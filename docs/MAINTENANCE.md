# Maintenance — how the macOS layer rides upstream

The port's survival thesis (PORTING_PRINCIPLES §1.1): **every unmergeable macOS
mega-fork has died** when its maintainer left. So the macOS work is kept as a
*thin, rebasable patch series on top of an upstream release tag*, not a
divergent fork. This doc is the procedure for keeping it that way.

## Branch model

```
upstream release tag (e.g. 2025.06.24)         ← beyond-all-reason/RecoilEngine
        │
        └── macos-<version>     = the tag + the macOS layer
                                  (upstream cherry-picks the tag predates +
                                   the platform / render / packaging work)
```

The macOS layer is what sits between the upstream tag and the branch tip. Keep it
**reviewable and scoped** so each piece can be upstreamed and so a rebase onto
the next tag is mechanical:
- platform code under `rts/System/Platform/Mac/`;
- rendering/present under `rts/Rendering/` and `Platform/Mac/MacPresentBackend`;
- cross-platform features (e.g. `WindowTitle`) unscoped and generic — no
  `#ifdef __APPLE__`, so upstream can take them as-is;
- **nothing under `rts/Sim/` or `rts/lib/streflop/` changes behavior** except
  the deterministic-FP work, which is enumerated in
  `SYNC_VALIDATION.md` Appendix A and is itself an upstream candidate.

Shipping happens on the pinned tag + macOS layer, nothing else: lockstep
multiplayer requires byte-identical simulation to the version the live fleet
runs.

## Bumping to a new upstream pin (the version-bump procedure)

When the fleet moves to a new engine version `NEW` (e.g. 2026.06.08):

1. **Branch from the upstream tag**, not from the old macOS branch:
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream --tags
   git checkout -b macos-NEW NEW
   ```
2. **Replay the macOS layer.** Rebase/cherry-pick the layer commits (the range
   `OLD_TAG..macos-OLD`, dropping the upstream cherry-picks the new tag already
   contains) onto `macos-NEW`. The commits are single-concern and rebasable by
   design.
3. **Resolve at the seams, not in Sim.** Conflicts should land in the macOS
   files above. If a conflict forces a change under `rts/Sim/` or streflop,
   stop — that is a determinism risk, not a merge chore (PORTING_PRINCIPLES §2).
4. **Re-run the gates** (all must pass on `macos-NEW` before it is a pin):
   ```sh
   scripts/build-engine.sh                 # + libm fleet-parity hash gate (9/9)
   # streflop cross-arch sync-test: BIT-EXACT vs both committed references
   # replay determinism: REPLAY_SYNC_OK on a NEW-version demo
   make certify                            # full packaging + GPU + replay cert
   ```
   Regenerate the streflop references only if the new tag deliberately changed
   streflop; otherwise a diff there is a bug, not an update.
5. **Update `docs/VERSIONS.md`** — never bump a pin silently.

## Releasing the app

`make app` (build/package, headless-safe) and `make certify` / `make release`
(adds GPU + replay certification). The engine pin is read from the built
engine (`spring --version`) and kept in `CFBundleVersion`/`EngineVersion`;
the user-facing release number comes from `packaging/PORT_VERSION`. See the
README "Building the macOS app". Long, GPU-, and content-dependent validation
is opt-in so build machines can package — mirrors upstream Recoil CI, where
the build workflow builds and a separate workflow validates.

**Every GitHub release's notes MUST start with
`packaging/release-notes-header.md` verbatim** — the persistent caution block
(unofficial port, third-party content downloaded at the user's own risk). It
mirrors the first-run consent dialog and the README caution; if one changes,
change all three.

**Every release must also review `message-config/messages/`.** Live messages
are fetched by every existing install and are version-targeted; a release that
changes behavior can make a live message wrong (e.g. when online play is
enabled, the "online disabled" messaging must be capped so it does not target
the new version — `"target": {"op": "le", "version": "<last-disabled>"}`).
Propose the concrete message changes and get the maintainer's explicit
sign-off before publishing the release.

## What to upstream (keep the layer shrinking)

`docs/UPSTREAM_CANDIDATES.md` tracks the fixes that belong upstream (LuaVAO
primitive-restart, stream-buffer wait, the float→int UB sweep, WindowTitle, …).
Every commit that lands upstream is one fewer to rebase next version — the
patch series should trend *smaller*, not larger, as the port matures.

## Ongoing Ehancements and Bug Fixes
- Don't start fixing a bug until you have developed a way to reliable reproduce it autonymously. Don't implement a new feature without a test and acceptance plan.
- Ensure you do not cause new regressions to logic, UI, performance such as FPS with any fix. If it touches an area which could cause a regression, make sure you test afterwards as part of the validation of the fix.
- When making changes or fixes and you notice an unreported bug, do not ignore it, tackle that too once your current task has finished, or make sure it is logged as a bug for a future fix. This includes visual bugs.
- Make sure you check upstream repos where relevant for similar bug reports or previous fixes.
- Ensure the fix is done in a way which is as painless as possible to later upstream. If it's not working on Apple and it is working on other platforms, don't simply change the logic for Apple, ask why. Maintainers are unlikely to accept it without good reason.
- Identify and fix root causes rather than ad-hoc fixes, or if not possible, prompt the user asking what to do.
- Every graphical fix must come with a regression test in the visreg harness (a testcard cell, scene shot, artifact detector, or logscan pattern that FAILS on the broken behavior), run before/after the fix, and a rebaseline. Run `scripts/visreg.sh --perf` before promoting any graphics/driver/present change. Harness + token-budget rules: `testkit/visreg/README.md` (outer working tree).
- If an issue cannot be recreated or fixed, or the fix is not fully confident, make sure infolog.txt would carry enough information for the NEXT report to be diagnosable (add targeted log lines / counters around the suspected area, verify they appear, ship them). Every infolog already identifies the port release (BAR_PORT_VERSION line), engine version, and game content (gametype line) — keep it that way.
- Builds run NO test stages by default (fast artifact gates only). For major changes or large commits, run the tests — with the build (`build-engine.sh --with-synctest --with-visreg [--with-perf]`; same flags on `release-build.sh`, plus `--certify` for replay smoke) or standalone (`scripts/run-synctest.sh`, `scripts/visreg.sh [--perf]`). Shipping artifacts must have passed all of them; skipped stages only warn.
- Do not respond directly to issues on github unless the user gives explicit consent
- Active issues can be found here, there may be duplicates: https://github.com/benbreen/RecoilEngine-AppleSilicon/issues
